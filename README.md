# Cyber Portfolio

Hands-on cybersecurity projects and lab write-ups.

## Projects
- **Splunk + Sysmon (Windows logging lab)**
  - Built a Windows logging setup using Sysmon + Splunk
  - Verified data was coming in and searched key events (process, network, DNS)
  - Write-up: projects/splunk-sysmon-lab/README.md

## What I’m practicing
- Log collection and searching (Splunk)
- Host event visibility (Sysmon)
- Basic threat hunting questions (what ran, what connected out, what DNS was queried)
