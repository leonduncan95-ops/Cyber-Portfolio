# Vulnerability Assessment (Linux + MySQL Server)

## One-line summary
Reviewed a database server setup, rated risks, and recommended security fixes to reduce the chance of data loss or unauthorized access.

## Tools used
- Risk assessment approach (NIST SP 800-30 reference)
- General security controls (MFA, RBAC, encryption)

## What I did 
1. Described the system and what it’s used for.
2. Identified realistic threat sources and what they might try to do.
3. Rated likelihood and impact to get a basic risk score.
4. Recommended security improvements (strong access control, MFA, safer encryption, and restricting network access).

## Why this matters
This shows how I think through “what could go wrong” and how to reduce risk with practical fixes.
