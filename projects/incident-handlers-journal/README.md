# Incident Handler’s Journal (IR Notes)

## One-line summary
Wrote incident notes using the “5 W’s” and practiced thinking through phishing/malware scenarios and next steps.

## Tools used
- VirusTotal (in one scenario)
- tcpdump (packet capture)
- Playbooks / alert tickets (training labs)

## What I did 
1. Logged incidents and summarized what happened in plain language.
2. Captured the “Who / What / When / Where / Why” to stay organized.
3. Wrote follow-up questions I’d want answered during an investigation.

## Why this matters
Being able to document incidents clearly is a real SOC skill — it helps your team understand what happened and what to do next.
