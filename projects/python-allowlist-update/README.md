# Python Allow-List Cleanup (Automation)

## One-line summary
Wrote a simple Python process to remove IPs from an allow list using a separate remove list, then saved the updated allow list back to the file.

## Tools used
- Python
- File read/write

## What I did 
1. Opened the allow list file and read the contents.
2. Converted the text into a list.
3. Compared it to a remove list.
4. Removed any matching IPs and wrote the updated list back to the file.

## Why this matters
Small automations like this save time and reduce mistakes when access lists need regular cleanup.
