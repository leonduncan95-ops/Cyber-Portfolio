# Apply Filters to SQL Queries (Investigation + Targeted Updates)

## One-line summary
Used SQL filters to investigate suspicious login activity and pull specific employee groups for updates.

## Tools used
- SQL (WHERE, AND/OR, NOT)

## What I did (high level)
1. Filtered for after-hours failed login attempts.
2. Checked login attempts on specific suspicious dates.
3. Filtered out logins that were not from Mexico.
4. Pulled employee lists by department (Marketing, Finance/Sales) and excluded IT when needed.

## Why this matters
Being able to filter data fast helps you spot weird activity quicker and target the right systems/users during an investigation.
